# SimplyP: a simple phosphorus model

This repository contains code to run a simple hydrology, sediment and phosphorus model, named **SimplyP**. The model is dynamic, working on a daily time step, and is spatially semi-distributed i.e. there is the ability to differentiate between hydrology, sediment and phosphorus processes, and between land use types and sub-catchments (with associated stream reaches). An application of the model is described in this paper:

and full details of the model itself are provided in the [Supplementary Information](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/2016WR020132/asset/supinfo/wrcr22702-sup-0001-2016WR020132-s01.pdf?v=1&s=fc5ee61527c9fc914b4c14b35562f30b85d3c927). 

The hydrology model used by SimplyP builds upon the one described [here](https://github.com/JamesSample/enviro_mod_notes.git) (see especially [notebook 5](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/enviro_mod_notes/blob/master/notebooks/05_A_Hydrological_Model.ipynb)). The remainder was developed by Leah Jackson-Blake and forms part of her PhD thesis. The work was funded by the RESAS, the Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division of the Scottish Government.

## Installation

If you don't have an up-to-date Python installation, a good option is the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Model development was carried out using **Python 2.7**.

1. From the Anaconda prompt, create a new clean conda environment for SimplyP

       conda create -n simplyp python=2.7
    
2. Activate the new environment

       activate simplyp
    
3. Install the Jupyter Notebook

       conda install jupyter=1.0.0 notebook=5.4.1
    
4. Download the [SimplyP repository](https://github.com/LeahJB/SimplyP) and unzip it to a location on your system

5. From the Anaconda command prompt, change directories to the 'SimplyP' folder (the one containing 'setup.py') and run

        python setup.py install    
    
## Running the model

A simple example illustrating how the model can be used is [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/LeahJB/SimplyP/blob/Hydrology_Model/SimplyP_v0-1A.ipynb). To run this example:

1. From the Anaconda prompt, activate your SimplyP environment

       activate simplyp
    
2. Change to the directory containing `'SimplyP_v0-1A.ipynb'` and run

       jupyter notebook
    
   then click the link to open `'SimplyP_v0-1A.ipynb'`. You should now be able to work through the notebook, running the code cells interactively.

3. When you have finished working with the model, click 'File > Close and Halt' (remember to save any changes first, if desired), then close the browser tab. On the `'Home'` tab, click `'Quit'` to shut down any Python kernels that may still be active, and then close this too.
