    "### Instructions for running the model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download [the repository](https://github.com/LeahJB/SimplyP) and open the model parameter Excel file, which is located in *Example_Data/Parameters_vx-xx_Tarland.xlsx* (replace the x-xx with the version number of the model that you are using, e.g. v0-2A). The excel file contains a 'Readme' sheet with further instructions but, as a minimum, you will need to **modify the file and folder paths** for the input data in the 'Setup' sheet to match those on your system. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Provide the full file path to the Excel parameter file in the notebook cell below and select the figure display option (further details are provided below, in the 'User input' cell) <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select 'Cell' (from the toolbar above) followed by 'Run all'. Alternatively, you can run one cell at a time by clicking within a cell and then selecting 'Cell'>Run cells, or by pressing Alt-Enter <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Wait, and then check that the model has run. Depending on your system, it may take around 4 seconds to run for a year for one sub-catchment/reach. The model will output results (stats and graphs) in this notebook once it has finished, and it will save any files of model output that you have requested be saved (using the 'Setup' parameters sheet in the parameters Excel file). You can keep a tab on whether or not the model is still running by looking at CPU usage via the task manager <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Check that there are no pink warning messages below the '#Run model' cell (heading 3). If running the model produces warnings, it is likely that one of your parameter values is too small or large - check your values against the recommended ranges. Alternatively, there may be a problem with your input data <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Model output may be saved to files (csvs and images) if the setup parameter options for saving to file are selected. Regardless, results are output in this notebook below - scroll down to see graphs and stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model does not run, scroll down this notebook to look for error messages. If there is one, check whether it relates to your input data or parameters, which may be in the wrong format or contain some other inconsistencies which are checked for by the model (e.g. land use fractions must sum to 1, the start and end dates in the Setup parameters sheet may be in the wrong format, etc.). Please report other error messages by [submitting a pull request via GitHub](https://github.com/LeahJB/SimplyP/pulls) or emailing Leah Jackson-Blake (<ljb@niva.no>).\n",
