SimplyP v0.1 and v0.2, description of input and output data files

Formatting:
- Dates should be in day-first European format, i.e. DD/MM/YYYY
- Decimal separators: points are expected, not commas. I'll add another setup parameter soon to allow for semi-colon separated files with decimal commas. Get in touch if you need that doing now.

########################################################################
1) Input: Model parameters

These are defined in an Excel sheet. See the Example_Data file for a template.

The file can have any name. The path to the file is entered at the top of the Jupyter notebook used to run the model.

The sheet names must not change, nor must the parameter names within the 'Param' column.

See the 'readme' on the first sheet of the parameter file for more information.

2) Input: Meteorological data to drive the model

This should be stored in csv format with column headings:

	Date (this must be the first column)
	Then in any order: Precipitation
					   T_air
	Optionally also:   PET

Description of variables:
	Precipitation: total precipitation (rain plus snow), units mm
	PET: potential evapotranspiration, units mm
	T_air: air temperature, units degrees Celsius.

If the time series in this file is longer than the period defined by the start and end dates in the parameter file ('Setup' sheet, parameters 'st_dt' and 'end_dt'), then it will be automatically truncated to coincide with the desired start and end dates. N.B. it must cover the period defined by the start and end dates.

If PET data is not provided, it will be calculated by the model using the Thornthwaite method. Note that this method may provide biased results, but has been chosen as a first approximation of PET as it is simple to implement and has low data requirements.

See the Example_Data file for a template

3) Optional input: observed discharge and water chemistry data

In Excel files. Create separate files for discharge and water chemistry data.
Files can have any name (the path to the files is entered by the user in the parameter 'Setup' sheet)
Within the files: insert data for separate reaches on separate sheets, and number the sheets with the reach number (e.g. 1, 2,...) ONLY (the model code expects sheet names to be integers, and will return an error if not)

Each sheet within the file should have the headings (excluding the comments in brackets):

Discharge data:
	Date (this must be the first column)
	Q

Water chemistry data:
	Date (this must be the first column)
	TP, PP, TDP, SRP, SS (optional; include any of these you have data for)
	
where:
	Q is the discharge (m3/s)
	TP is total P (mg/l)
	PP is particulate P (mg/l)
	TDP is total dissolved P (mg/l)
	SRP is soluble reactive P (mg/l)
	SS is suspended sediment (mg/l)

Any columns in the sheet with  names aside from these will not be read in (but need not be deleted from the file)
	
As with the meteorological input data, observations are automatically truncated to the start and end dates given in the parameter setup sheet

See the Example_Data file for templates

4) Optional output: Instream results

csvs of simulated in-stream results are provided for all reaches and for the summed inputs to a receiving waterbody (if simulated).
Files are labelled:
	Instream_results_Reach#.csv where # is the reach number
	Instream_results_receiving_waterbody.csv

Files have the following columns in addition to the date:

Model output:
	Vr:   Reach volume (mm)
	Qr:   Mean daily discharge from the reach (mm/d)
	Msus: Daily flux of suspended sediment from the reach (kg/day)
	TDPr: Daily flux of total dissolved P from the reach (kg/day)
	PPr:  Daily flux of particulate P from the reach (kg/day)

Post-processing:
	Sim_Q_cumecs: Daily mean discharge (m3/s)
	Daily fluxes:
		TPr: Daily flux of total P from the reach (kg/day)
		SRPr: Daily flux of total P from the reach (kg/day)
	Concentrations in mg/l:
		PP_mgl: particulate P
		SRP_mgl: soluble reactive P
		SS_mgl: suspended sediment
		TDP_mgl: total dissolved P
		TP_mgl: total P

4) Optional output: Terrestrial compartment results

csvs of simulated results for the terrestrial compartment are produced for all sub-catchments.
Filenames: Results_TC_SC#.csv, where # is the sub-catchment number.

Files include the following columns in addition to the date:

C_cover_A:	  Soil cover and erodibility factor for agricultural land			
D_snow:		  Snow depth (mm)
EPC0_A_kgmm:  EPC0 in agricultural soil (kg/mm)
EPC0_A_mgl:	  EPC0 in agricultural soil (mg/l)
EPC0_NC_kgmm: EPC0 in newly-converted agricultural or semi-natural soil (kg/mm)       
EPC0_NC_mgl:  EPC0 in newly-converted agricultural or semi-natural soil (mg/l).
			  Only calculated if have NC land
P_labile_A:   Labile soil P mass in agricultural land (kg)
P_labile_NC:  Labile soil P mass in newly-converted agricultural or semi-natural land (kg)
Plabile_A_mgkg: Labile soil P content on agricultural land (mg P/kg soil)
Plabile_NC_mgkg: Labile soil P content on newly-converted land (mg P/kg soil);
				 only calculated if have newly-converted land
TDPs_A:       Soil water TDP mass, agricultural land (kg)
TDPs_A_mgl:   Soil water TDP concentration, agricultural land (mg/l)
TDPs_NC_mgl:  Soil water TDP concentration, agricultural land (mg/l).
			  Only calculated if have NC land
TDPs_NC:      Soil water TDP mass, newly-converted agricultural or semi-natural land (kg)
Qg:           Groundwater flow (mm/d)
Qq:           Quick flow (mm/d)
QsA:          Soil water flow, agricultural land (mm/d)
QsS:          Soil water flow, semi-natural land (mm/d)
Vg:           Groundwater volume (mm)
VsA:          Soil water volume, agricultural land (mm)
VsS:          Soil water volume, semi-natural land (mm)
