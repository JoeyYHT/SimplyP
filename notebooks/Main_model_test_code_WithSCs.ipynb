    "21/01/2016: Still sorting plots out. Need to divide plot 3 from the terrestrial compartment by catchment area in km2 or ha, to get normalised flux, so that it's the same per sub-catchment? BUT, this wouldn't be the same per sub-catchment if the slope changed between catchments... Then finish off reach plot.\n",

    "To do, for PhD:\n",
    "* Parameter file: tidy up. Provide recommended ranges and suggested default for each parameter, plus link to sources of info\n",
    "* Tidy up GitHub repository: Separate from James' repository, delete old notebooks, write clear instructions for running model\n",
    "* Tidy up code in main ipython notebook\n",
    "* If have time, do big dictionary to change column headings for the output model results dataframes, so they're more friendly (e.g. including units), for terrestrial compartment & reach results\n",
    "\n",
    "To do, longer term:\n",
    "* hydrology model uses a sustainable flow parameter, as in INCA. This is a fudge and needs replacing\n",
    "* Add saturation excess to quick flow\n",
    "* As sediment equations don't use stream velocity, the only thing it's used in at the moment is to calculate the reach time constant. Excessive, as it's two parameters? Can't re-calculate using v=Q/A, as it becomes circular when you try to work out T and V. Other options to reduce the number of parameters?\n",
    "* What to do about quick flow? Should it vary by land use type? And if so, how? No quick flow apart from from agricultural land? Or quick flow from both, but more from agricultural land?\n",
    "* Investigate whether having quick flow separated between agricultural and semi-natural land means that there's no longer the need for them to have different time constants\n",
    "* TDP to SRP conversion. Best means of doing this? Do individually for agricultural and effluent inputs, and then combine?\n",
    "* Option for dynamic effluent P inputs, i.e. option to read in a time series\n",
    "* Option for dynamic terrestrial P inputs\n",
    "* Option for dynamic groundwater TDP concentration, somehow linked to what's happening overhead"
